An update to my first speed trainer, which can be accessed at github.com/jacobcollinsdev/chessapp.

A random coordinate will be generated and the user must click on the corresponding square as quickly. Try to score as many points as you can in 20 seconds.

Can be viewed online at: https://chesscoordinates.netlify.app

Improvements include:
- Settings option to turn off audio and show/hide board coordinates.
- Improved user interface.
- Game duration represented by progress bar instead of a clock.
- Accuracy is now measured.
- Results table shown and updated after each new attempt.
